Hi 👋

I'm Aslam.

Most of my time goes into running [Micro.company](https://micro.company), where we build SaaS products that are genuinely useful without being overcomplicated. We're not solving earth-shattering, life-changing problems. We deliver simple stuff with some of the best customer experience. That's what we focus on.

Everywhere I look, walk, or listen, I feel there are a lot of problems around us that need simple solutions. We humans are smart and have come up with incredible things, but I still think there's a lot of room to make the world a little simpler and more beautiful. Problem solving is something I enjoy, almost like a hobby, and it keeps my mind busy.

I also love to meet people who are working on new ideas or starting something fresh. Having a brainstorm session with them, figuring out what problem they're solving and how they plan to solve it—that's literally something I always look forward to. If I can help by sharing my thoughts or just thinking out loud together, even better. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mailaslamabbas@gmail.com) if you want to connect.

I live in Kerala with my family. I cycle, read, travel when I get the chance, and try to stay curious about most things. And this tiny blog right here is my small space on the internet where I jot down my thoughts, ideas, and things I find helpful.

Thanks for stopping by 🙏
