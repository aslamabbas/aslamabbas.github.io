Hi üëã

I‚Äôm Aslam.

It‚Äôs really hard to write an about section about myself. But it‚Äôs kinda important to let those search engine crawlers know who I am. I don‚Äôt want them to confuse me with someone else. So here goes.

Primarily, my time is spent at [Micro.company](https://micro.company) where we build super useful SaaS products for the entire world. We‚Äôre not solving earth-shattering, life-changing problems. We deliver simple stuff with some of the best customer experience. That‚Äôs what we focus on.

One of my favorite things to do is to deep dive into problem solving. Everywhere I look, walk, or listen, I feel there are a lot of problems around us that need simple solutions. Even though we humans are super smart and have come up with some amazing, ingenious solutions, I still believe there‚Äôs room for improvement, and we can continue to make the world simpler and more beautiful. Problem solving is something I enjoy, almost like a hobby, and it keeps my mind busy.

I also love to meet people who are working on new ideas or starting something fresh. Having a brainstorm session with them, figuring out what problem they‚Äôre solving and how they plan to solve it‚Äîthat‚Äôs literally something I always look forward to. It‚Äôs like a rare treat. It doesn‚Äôt come every day. And if I can help them out by sharing my thoughts, I‚Äôm happy to do so. It‚Äôs an opportunity to learn something new. [Shoot me an email](mailto:mailaslamabbas@gmail.com) if you want to connect.

I live in this beautiful place called Kerala with my small family. I enjoy short travels. I try to maintain my health in subtle ways. And this tiny blog right here is my small space on the internet where I jot down my thoughts, ideas, and things I find helpful.

Thanks for stopping by üôè
