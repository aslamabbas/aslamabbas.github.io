**Marina Beach**

This is was one of my favourite places to visit in Chennai. Beaches are in plenty in Chennai. When you live in Chennai, you don't apppreciate their value. But when you move further inland, you miss the ocean. I made the above SVG just to take a moment to go back to some of the best memories. It was made using <https://github.com/maxwellito/vivus>
